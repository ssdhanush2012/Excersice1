    <center><h3>Healthy Fruits</h3></center>
    <dl type="1">
        <dt>1.Apple</dt>
        <dd>One of the most popular fruits, apples are chock-full of nutrition.

            They’re rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, such as pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. These help you manage your blood sugar levels, promote good digestion, and support gut and heart health (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).
            
            In addition, they’re a good source of vitamin C and plant polyphenols, which are disease-fighting compounds found in plants. In fact, consuming apples regularly may lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, overweight, obesity, and neurological disorders (3Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).
            
            Note that most of the polyphenols in apples are located just below the skin, so be sure to eat it to reap the greatest benefits.</dd>

            <dt>2. Blueberries</dt>
            <dd>Blueberries are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

                In particular, they’re high in anthocyanin, a plant pigment and flavonoid that gives blueberries their characteristic blue-purple color. This compound helps fight cell-damaging free radicals that can lead to disease (8Trusted Source).
                
                Numerous studies have pointed to the health benefits of a diet high in anthocyanins, such as a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, overweight, obesity, high blood pressure, certain types of cancer, and cognitive decline (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).
                
                For example, a study including over 200,000 participants observed a 5% decrease in the risk of type 2 diabetes for every 17 grams of anthocyanin-rich berries they consumed per day (14Trusted Source).
                
                Other berries high in anthocyanins include blackberries, bilberry, elderberry, cherries, and chokeberries (8Trusted Source).</dd>
        
                <dt>3. Bananas</dt>
                <dd>The benefits of bananas go beyond their potassium content. Along with providing 7% of the Daily Value (DV) for potassium, bananas contain (15Trusted Source):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vitamin B6: 27% of the DV</li>
                        <li>Vitamin C: 12% of the DV</li>
                        <li>Magnesium: 8% of the DV</li>
                    </ul>
                    In addition, they offer a wide variety of plant compounds called polyphenols and phytosterols, both of which support your overall health. Furthermore, they’re high in prebiotics, a type of fiber that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).

Note that green, unripe bananas are higher in resistant starch than ripe ones, and they’re a good source of the dietary fiber pectin. Both of these have been linked to a number of health benefits, including improved blood sugar control and better digestive health (20, 21Trusted Source).

Meanwhile, ripe bananas are an excellent source of easily digested carbs, making them great to fuel up on before a workout (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).
                </dd>
                <dt>4. Oranges </dt>
                <dd>Oranges are known for their high vitamin C content, providing 91% of the DV in a single fruit. They’re also high in potassium, folate, thiamine (vitamin B1), fiber, and plant polyphenols (24Trusted Source).

                    Studies have found that consuming whole oranges may lower levels of inflammation, blood pressure, cholesterol, and post-meal blood sugar (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).
                    
                    Though 100% orange juice provides a high volume of nutrients and antioxidants, it usually lacks dietary fiber. Varieties that include the pulp do include some fiber, so opt for these over juices without pulp.
                    
                    That said, try to eat whole oranges more often, and keep juice portions to 1 cup (235 mL) or less per serving.</dd>
                    <dt>5. Dragon fruit</dt>
                    <dd>Also known as pitaya or pitahaya, dragon fruit is rich in many nutrients, including fiber, iron, magnesium, and vitamins C and E. It’s also an excellent source of carotenoids, such as lycopene and beta carotene (26Trusted Source).

                        People in Southeast Asian cultures have regarded dragon fruit highly for hundreds of years as a health-promoting fruit. Over recent decades, it has gained popularity in Western countries (26Trusted Source).</dd>

    <div class="fruit1">
        <dl>
            <dt>Acerola cherries</dt>
            <dd>
                Native to countries in the western hemisphere such as Barbados and the West Indies, "acerola cherries are one of the foods highest in vitamin C," says Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, MS, RDN, founder of 360Girls&Women, LLC., and they also deliver an array of other phytochemicals. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that functions as an antioxidant to "support immunity and help with collagen synthesis for healthy skin and joints," adds Anderson-Haynes.

    <div class="fruit2">
        <dl>
            <dt>Kiwiberry</dt>
            <dd>This relative of the furry-fleshed kiwi is much smaller but just as nutritious. Smooth-skinned with the same sweet tartness as larger kiwis, the kiwiberry is a robust source of vitamin C and also contains lutein (a player in eye health), as well as other essential nutrients such as potassium, calcium and zinc.</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

    <div class="fruit3">
        <dl>
            <dt>Papaya</dt>
            <dd>
                This tropical fruit boasts an impressive list of nutrients. Papaya is a good source of vitamins A, C and E, which play a role in immunity, skin health and heart health, as well as fiber (especially if you eat the seeds, which some people may find a bit bitter, but they're totally edible).

    <div class="fruit4">
        <dl>
            <dt>Apricot</dt>
            <dd>
                You may be more familiar with the dried version of this tangy stone fruit, but if you see the fresh kind at your supermarket or farmers market, grab some! Apricots are a good source of several nutrients involved in vision health, such as lutein, vitamin E and beta-carotene, a plant compound that our body converts to vitamin A.

    <div class="fruit5">
        <dl>
            <dt>Watermelon</dt>
            <dd>
                Watermelon is 92% water, making it a great choice for hydration. Your food provides about 20% of your fluid intake, and eating water-packed snacks like watermelon can help you avoid subtle, headache-spurring dehydration, London says. What makes watermelon an extra great hydration helper is that it's also a source of potassium and magnesium, two minerals that function as electrolytes to help balance fluid levels and offset excess sodium in your diet. Try it in a salad with feta and mint — or grill it for a summery dessert!
